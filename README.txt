To run the script type the name of the general folder where all the sample folders are located, followed by the name of the output file and the number of dimensions the output vector should have.

Example:

$ a3_features.py scratch/lt2222-v23/enron_sample my_output_file 100


About ethics:

One of the first things that I noticed while taking a look at the data was, indeed, how the names of real people were displayed without any sort of censure or protection. "Who would like to hire people involved in all this in the future?" was a sudden thought that flashed through my mind.

There are two things to take into account here.
First, nobody's data should be made public without their consent, no matter the situation they have been involved with. If the people involved in the court case were prosecuted or had any sort of law penalty applied to them, then the legal system of their country is the one who should deal with their data in the appropriate way. 

Second, and answering the comment regarding the "legal loophole" there might be in terms of permission in this case, the origin of the data shouldn't exclude it from being adequately handled. We should establish protocols and rules that manage data when it is made available in cyberspace.

I recently had the opportunity to listen to a podcast episode about the repercussions of having a criminal history. Even for the "smallest" offenses, such as stealing a bike, the aftermath may be completely disastrous for those who committed the offense. "That's on them", we may think, "They should have thought twice about what they were doing", many of us may think. However, sometimes the punishment can produce quite the unfair result, ironically enough, for the offender. The Hammurabi Law may get abused and our desire to condemn may get out of hand.

That is why I believe that these people should not have their names displayed. The case did not involve extreme circumstances, as far as I am concerned, but the integrity of the people should be respected regardless.

It is also true that time and space make a difference: it wouldn't have been ethical at all to use the corpus three years after the incident, but it has been around twenty years already. Also, some of the people who access the data might not even live close to the United States or understand what the case was about.
Furthermore, one could argue that respect for personal data should have an expiry date, in cases such as this one.
My question then would be: when should that be? 

I believe that data protection should be permanent, or at least, last long enough to protect the people in question for as long as they live. I also believe protocols should be established to protect data and people in cyberspace if we want a fair and good use of the wonderful tools it presents us with.
